## Corrective Actions

### Action 1: Update screen-agent/requirements.txt

**Current State (LOOSE):**
```
fastapi>=0.111.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.29.0
pydantic>=2.7.0
httpx>=0.27.0
pynput>=1.7.6
python-xlib>=0.33
```

**Corrected State (EXACT):**
```
fastapi==0.115.5
uvicorn[standard]==0.32.1
pydantic==2.10.1
httpx==0.27.2
pynput==1.7.6
python-xlib==0.34
```

**Rationale:** 
- Ensures reproducible builds across environments
- Prevents unexpected behavior from dependency updates
- Aligns with other service versions

---

### Action 2: Update tests/e2e/requirements.txt

**Current State (LOOSE):**
```
pytest>=8.2.0
requests>=2.31.0
```

**Corrected State (EXACT):**
```
pytest==8.2.3
requests==2.32.3
```

**Rationale:**
- E2E tests must be reproducible
- Same version across all developers and CI environments

---

## Dependency Compatibility Matrix

## Recommendations

### Immediate (PHASE B-2)

- [ ] Update `screen-agent/requirements.txt` to exact versions
- [ ] Update `tests/e2e/requirements.txt` to exact versions
- [ ] Run `make test-all` to verify compatibility
- [ ] Run `make test-e2e` to verify E2E still passes

### Short-term (PHASE B-3)

- [ ] Audit all dev requirements files
- [ ] Create dependency update policy (monthly)
- [ ] Document breaking change detection process
- [ ] Add `make audit-deps` to CI/CD

### Medium-term (PHASE C)

- [ ] Set up automated security scanning (Safety, Bandit)
- [ ] Configure Dependabot for automatic updates
- [ ] Document minimum Python/Node versions per service
- [ ] Add dependency licenses audit

### Long-term (PHASE D+)

- [ ] Evaluate dependency consolidation (e.g., shared requirements-base.txt)
- [ ] Monitor for security updates (monthly reviews)
- [ ] Plan major version upgrades (FastAPI 0.115 → 1.0)
- [ ] Document rollback procedures for dependency updates

## Testing Procedure

After applying corrective actions:

```bash
# 1. Run all unit tests
make test-all

# 2. Run E2E tests
make test-e2e

# 3. Verify Docker builds
docker-compose build

# 4. Start services
make dev-up

# 5. Check health
for port in 11430 11431 11433 11436; do
  curl http://localhost:$port/healthz || echo "FAILED: port $port"
done

# 6. Stop services
make dev-down
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All E2E tests pass
- ✅ Docker builds succeed
- ✅ Services start and report healthy
- ✅ No warnings or errors in logs
