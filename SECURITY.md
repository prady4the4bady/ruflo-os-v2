# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest stable Prady OS release line.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| v1.0.x | Yes |
| < v1.0.0 | No |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Please report with:

- Affected component or service
- Reproduction steps
- Expected and observed behavior
- Impact assessment
- Any proposed mitigation or workaround

Use a private maintainer contact or repository security reporting channel.

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage update: within 7 days
- Remediation timeline: based on severity and exploitability

## Disclosure Process

1. Report received and validated.
2. Affected versions and surfaces confirmed.
3. Fix prepared and regression-tested.
4. Coordinated disclosure published with remediation guidance.

## Security Baseline

Prady OS v1.0.0 applies these baseline controls:

- Policy-gated agent actions in platform runtime
- Service-level health and diagnostics endpoints
- Signed release artifacts with checksum support
- Strict test, typecheck, lint, and compose validation gates

## Hardening Recommendations

- Keep secrets out of source control and rotate credentials regularly.
- Restrict service exposure to trusted networks only.
- Enable HTTPS and authenticated service-to-service communication in production.
- Monitor logs for denied actions, unusual request bursts, and repeated task failures.
- Pin, review, and audit dependencies as part of each release cycle.

## Scope

This policy covers first-party Prady OS components in this repository.
Third-party upstream mirrors and vendored projects follow their own security policies.

**Controls:**
- Network isolation (no public exposure)
- Resource limits (memory, CPU)
- Restart policies (fail-safe)
- Health checks on all services

---

## Security Controls

### 1. API Gateway (model-gateway)

**Purpose:** Single entry point for all LLM requests.

**Controls:**
- API key management (per model, per environment)
- Rate limiting (100 req/min per model)
- Request/response validation (JSON schema)
- Audit logging (all queries, responses, latencies)
- Error handling (no credential leaks in errors)

**Implementation:**
```python
@app.post("/v1/chat/completions")
async def chat_completions(req: ChatCompletionRequest):
    # Validate request
    validate_request(req)
    
    # Log request (no sensitive data)
    audit_log.info(f"chat_completions: {req.model}, tokens={len(req.messages)}")
    
    # Route based on policy
    response = await route_to_model(req)
    
    # Log response (metadata only)
    audit_log.info(f"response: {response.model}, tokens={response.usage.total_tokens}")
    
    return response
```

---

### 2. Approval Workflow (workflow-engine)

**Purpose:** Require human approval for high-risk tasks.

**Controls:**
- Task classification (cost, destructive, sensitive)
- Approval queue with timeout (300s default)
- Audit logging of approval decisions
- Auto-approval configurable

**Approval Triggers:**
- File deletion
- Network requests (HTTP POST/PUT/DELETE)
- Email/message sending
- Large-scale operations (>10 subtasks)
- Cost > $1.00

**Implementation:**
```python
async def execute_task(task: TaskRequest):
    # Classify risk
    risk_level = classify_task(task)
    
    if risk_level in ["high", "destructive"]:
        # Require approval
        approval = ApprovalRecord(
            task_id=task.id,
            risk_level=risk_level,
            timeout_at=now() + APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        )
        approvals_queue.append(approval)
        await wait_for_approval(approval)
    
    # Execute
    result = await execute(task)
    return result
```

---

### 3. Policy Gating (screen-agent)

**Purpose:** Control desktop automation actions with security policies.

**Controls:**
- Whitelist/blacklist actions
- Parameter validation (paths, commands)
- Real-time policy evaluation
- Detailed audit logging

**Policy Example:**
```yaml
# /app/config/policy.yaml

# Whitelist safe actions
allow:
  - action: screenshot
  - action: mouse-click
    constraints:
      target_region: screen  # not outside screen bounds
  - action: browser-navigate
    constraints:
      domain_whitelist:
        - github.com
        - news.ycombinator.com

# Blacklist dangerous actions
deny:
  - action: shell-execute
    reason: "No direct shell access"
  - action: file-delete
    reason: "Destructive operation"
  - action: sudo-run
    reason: "No privilege escalation"
  - action: read-keychain
    reason: "No credential access"
```

---

### 4. Audit Trail

**Purpose:** Create immutable record of all operations for forensics.

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "workflow-engine",
  "event": "task_executed",
  "task_id": "task_abc123",
  "session_id": "sess_user_123",
  "user_goal": "[redacted]",
  "subtasks_executed": 3,
  "approval_required": true,
  "approval_status": "approved",
  "result": "success",
  "duration_ms": 2345
}
```

**Audit Logs Locations:**
- `/ai-core/model-gateway/logs/queries.jsonl` — LLM queries
- `/orchestration/workflow-engine/logs/activities.jsonl` — Task execution
- `/automation/screen-agent/logs/actions.jsonl` — Desktop actions
- `/agents/lumyn/logs/sessions.jsonl` — Conversations

**Retention:** 90 days (configurable)

---

### 5. Secrets Management

**Current State (Development):**
- API keys in `.env` (gitignored)
- Keys injected as environment variables
- No key rotation automated

**Production Requirements:**
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Automatic key rotation (monthly)
- Encryption at rest and in transit (HTTPS)
- Audit logging for key access
- Short-lived credentials (STS tokens)

```
Event: API_ERROR
Level: CRITICAL
Service: model-gateway
Error: 401 Unauthorized (OpenAI API)
```

**Response:**
1. Verify API key: `env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Test key with curl: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" https://api.openai.com/v1/models`
3. Check API provider dashboard for suspicious activity
4. Rotate key immediately if compromised
5. Update .env and restart: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-new...; docker-compose restart model-gateway`

---

#### Alert 3: Redis Memory Critical (redis)

```
Event: MEMORY_HIGH
Level: WARNING
Service: redis
Memory: 95% of limit
```

**Response:**
1. Check memory usage: `docker-compose exec redis redis-cli INFO memory`
2. Identify large keys: `docker-compose exec redis redis-cli --bigkeys`
3. Check task queue depth: `docker-compose exec redis redis-cli LLEN tasks:queue`
4. Option A: Clear old sessions (if safe): `docker-compose exec redis redis-cli EVAL "return redis.call('del', ...)" 0`

3. For low-risk approvals, approve them: `curl -X POST http://localhost:11431/task/ID/approve -d '{"decision": "approve"}'`
4. For high-risk approvals, investigate first
5. For stuck approvals (timeout reached), auto-approve or reject: `curl -X POST ... -d '{"decision": "reject", "reason": "timeout"}'`

---

### Containment & Recovery

#### Immediate Actions (T+0 to T+15 minutes)

1. **Isolate Compromised Service:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose stop <service>
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs <service> > /tmp/incident-logs.txt
   docker cp redis-container:/data/dump.rdb /tmp/incident-redis.rdb
   ```

3. **Notify Team:**
   - Post to #security Slack channel
   - Create incident ticket (title, timeline, impact)

4. **Assess Blast Radius:**
   - Which services affected?
   - Which users affected?
   - What data exposed?

---

#### Remediation (T+15 to T+60 minutes)

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Review audit logs: Was input validation bypassed?
   - Check policy settings: Was policy misconfigured?
   - Inspect code: Any recent changes?

2. **Implement Fix:**
   - Patch input validation
   - Tighten policy rules
   - Update dependencies (if vulnerable)

3. **Test Fix:**
   - Run full test suite: `make test-all`
   - Specifically test vulnerable path
   - Deploy to staging first

4. **Deploy Fix:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   docker-compose ps  # Verify all healthy
   ```

---

#### Post-Incident (T+60 minutes to T+24 hours)

1. **Write Incident Report:**
   - Timeline
   - Root cause
   - Impact assessment
   - Mitigation steps
   - Prevention measures

2. **Communication:**
   - Notify affected users
   - Publish post-mortem (internal wiki)
   - Schedule team retrospective

3. **Prevention:**
   - Update security checklist
   - Add test case for vulnerability
   - Update runbook
   - Monitor for recurrence
