# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## v1.0.0 — Phase 42 — 2026-05-14 "Final Verification"

### Added
- platform/tests/test_feature_claims.py: Verifies every public claim about Prady OS is backed by a passing test. The honesty contract in code form.
- HONEST_LIMITATIONS.md: Documents what does not work, what is a stub, what requires specific hardware. Nothing hidden.
- README.md: Final production version with verified feature table, install instructions, complete service map (44 services).

### Changed
- README.md fully rewritten to production quality. Every claim maps to a test file or service.

## v1.0.0 — Phase 41 — 2026-05-14 "Self-Organization"

### Added
- Idle-time research trigger: Prax monitors CPU and RAM every 5 minutes. When idle 30+ minutes, starts inventor research.
- Weekly digest: Every Monday 9AM Prax sends honest stats to notification-bus. Failures never hidden.
- GET /inventor/digest: Returns weekly stats and honest summary via API.
- Weekly Digest UI card: 6 metric tiles in InventorDashboard showing real weekly numbers.

### Fixed
- Compose parity: kryos-researcher and proposal-gate were missing from prod compose. Now 44/44 match.

## v1.0.0 — Phase 39 — 2026-05-13 "Prax Invents"

### Added: Prax Inventor Engine
- Prax now discovers unsolved problems autonomously by scanning ArXiv, HackerNews, GitHub Trending, and ProductHunt every 6 hours using Lumyn reasoning
- Proposal card system: Prax presents one honest proposal showing problem, impact, tools, time estimate, confidence level, and honest caveats
- User sees exactly two buttons: Build It / Not Interested
- 6-agent build pipeline: Architect → Developer → QA → Documenter → Verifier
- VerifierAgent runs cold-start Docker verification before any project is delivered
- Projects are never released if verification fails
- Automatic GitHub push and release creation
- Inventor Dashboard UI with live build progress
- Full SQLite persistence for proposals and projects
- FilesystemBrain tiered file access zones (FREE/ASK/NEVER)

  - Vyrex
  - Lumyn Agent
- ISO naming and release messaging updated to v1.0.0 conventions
- Build and CI artifact paths aligned with release outputs
- Gate validation scripts and tests aligned with release closure requirements

### Fixed

- Pytest import/collision handling across hyphenated platform service folders
- Desktop shell TypeScript and ESLint regressions in MenuBar/AppStore integration
- Post-rename Python package path consistency (`kryos_sdk`, `vyrex_proxy`, `vyrex.runtime`)
- Build/ISO test regressions caused by renamed expected files

### Validation Snapshot

- `python -m pytest ... -W error::DeprecationWarning -q --tb=short`
  - 710 passed, 2 skipped, 8 warnings, 0 failed
- TypeScript/ESLint gates:
  - desktop shell strict typecheck: pass
  - desktop shell eslint max warnings 0: pass
  - SDK strict typecheck: pass
- Compose/script syntax gates:
  - dev compose config: pass
  - prod compose config: pass
  - build/sign/write shell syntax: pass
- Gate 9 canonical old-name scan:
  - clean for the required legacy term set
- Gate 10 runtime smoke:
  - requires Docker Desktop on the Windows host

### Notes

- Gate 10 remains environment-dependent and must be executed manually on a host with Docker Desktop running.
