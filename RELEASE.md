## Version Scheme

Prady OS v2 uses **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0**:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Example: v2.1.3
  2 = Major (breaking changes)
  1 = Minor (new features, backward compatible)
  3 = Patch (bug fixes, no new features)
```

### Version Bumping Rules

- **PATCH:** Bug fixes, security updates (v2.1.3 → v2.1.4)
- **MINOR:** New features, enhanced capabilities (v2.1.4 → v2.2.0)
- **MAJOR:** Breaking API changes, system redesign (v2.0.0 → v3.0.0)

### Release Cadence

- **Regular Releases:** Monthly (first Monday)
- **Security Hotfixes:** As needed (within 24 hours of discovery)
- **Critical Patches:** As needed (production outage)

## Release Checklist

### Week 1: Planning

- [ ] Identify features/fixes for release (from GitHub issues)
- [ ] Update VERSION file: `echo "2.X.0" > VERSION`
- [ ] Create release branch: `git checkout -b release/v2.X.0`
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with features
- [ ] Assign release manager
- [ ] Schedule release date

### Week 2-3: Development & Testing

- [ ] All features complete and merged to release branch
- [ ] Code review completed (2+ approvals)
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-all`
- [ ] E2E tests pass: `make test-e2e`
- [ ] Performance benchmarks run (compare to v2.X-1)
- [ ] Security scan passes: `make security-scan` (when implemented)
- [ ] Dependency audit passes: `make audit-deps`

### Release Day: Pre-Deployment

#### Morning (T-4 hours)

- [ ] Final verification on staging: `make validate`
- [ ] Database migration tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback plan reviewed with team
- [ ] Communication prepared (status page, Slack message)
- [ ] On-call rotation confirmed

#### 1 Hour Before

- [ ] Freeze code (no new commits to release branch)
- [ ] Build Docker images: `docker-compose build`
- [ ] Tag images with version: `docker tag model-gateway:latest model-gateway:v2.X.0`
- [ ] Push images to registry: `docker push model-gateway:v2.X.0`
- [ ] Create Git tag: `git tag -a v2.X.0 -m "Release v2.X.0"`
- [ ] Push tag: `git push origin v2.X.0`

#### Deployment

- [ ] Notify stakeholders: "Release v2.X.0 starting at [TIME]"
- [ ] Blue-green deployment: Deploy to alternate infrastructure
- [ ] Health checks: All services passing `/healthz`
- [ ] Smoke tests: Run critical paths (HN task, session persistence)
- [ ] Switch traffic: Update DNS/load balancer to point to new deployment
- [ ] Confirm traffic: Monitor metrics for anomalies

### Post-Deployment (T+30 minutes)

- [ ] All services healthy: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] No error spikes in logs: `docker-compose logs | grep ERROR`
- [ ] API responses normal: `curl http://localhost:11430/healthz`
- [ ] Database queries fast: `redis-cli --latency`
- [ ] Users reporting normal experience

### Post-Release (T+24 hours)

- [ ] Review logs for errors or warnings
- [ ] Check metrics for anomalies
- [ ] Monitor third-party APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for issues
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] If all clear: Mark release as stable
- [ ] If issues: Proceed to rollback

---

## Deployment Pipeline

### Infrastructure Setup (Pre-Requisite)

```bash
# Build all Docker images with version tag
VERSION=2.X.0
docker-compose build
docker tag $(docker images -q ai-core/model-gateway:latest) ai-core/model-gateway:$VERSION
docker tag $(docker images -q orchestration/workflow-engine:latest) orchestration/workflow-engine:$VERSION
# ... repeat for all services

# Push to registry (or use local registry for private deployment)
docker push ai-core/model-gateway:$VERSION
docker push orchestration/workflow-engine:$VERSION
# ... repeat for all services
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

```bash
# Current state: Green deployment active

# Prepare blue deployment with new version
export BLUE_VERSION=2.X.0
docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue.yml up -d

# Health checks on blue
curl http://localhost:18000/healthz  # model-gateway (blue on 18000)
curl http://localhost:18001/healthz  # workflow-engine (blue on 18001)
# ... all services

# Run smoke tests against blue
make test-e2e ENDPOINT=http://localhost:18000

# Switch traffic from green to blue
# Update DNS/load balancer: 
#   old: 11430 → new: 18000
#   old: 11431 → new: 18001
#   ... all ports

# Keep green running for quick rollback
# Monitor blue for 30 minutes
# Then decommission green
```

### Canary Deployment (Alternative)

```bash
# Route 10% of traffic to new version
# Monitor error rate, latency, throughput
# If OK, increase to 25%, then 50%, then 100%
# If issues, rollback to 0%

# This requires load balancer with canary support
# Not recommended for single-instance deployments
```

### Progressive Rollout

```bash
# Deploy to groups of services in order
# 1. Redis (no dependencies)
# 2. model-gateway (depends: redis)
# 3. workflow-engine (depends: redis, model-gateway)
# 4. screen-agent (depends: model-gateway)
# 5. lumyn (depends: all above)

# Health check after each service
docker-compose restart redis && sleep 15
curl http://localhost:6379  # Redis
curl http://localhost:11430/healthz  # model-gateway
# ... repeat for each service
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)

If issues detected immediately after deployment:

```bash
# Step 1: Switch traffic back to previous version
# Update load balancer to use green deployment (if using blue-green)
# OR
docker-compose down  # Stop blue deployment
docker-compose.green.yml up -d  # Start green deployment

# Step 2: Verify old version working
curl http://localhost:11430/healthz

# Step 3: Notify team
# Post to #incidents Slack channel
# "ROLLBACK: v2.X.0 → v2.X-1.0 due to [ISSUE]"
```

### Detailed Rollback

If issues discovered after 30 minutes:

1. **Stop New Deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose kill
   ```

2. **Restore Previous Version:**
   ```bash
   git checkout v2.X-1.0
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Functionality:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
   curl http://localhost:11430/healthz
   make test-e2e
   ```

4. **Restore Data (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   # Restore Redis snapshot
   docker cp /backup/redis-v2.X-1.0.rdb redis-container:/data/dump.rdb
   docker-compose restart redis
   ```

5. **Confirm Stability:**
   ```bash
   # Monitor logs for 1 hour
   docker-compose logs -f | grep -E "ERROR|CRITICAL"
   ```

### Preventing Cascading Failures

Rollback safeguards:

- [ ] Always keep previous version running (blue-green)
- [ ] Use feature flags to disable new features if issues arise
- [ ] Monitor database migrations (ensure rollback-safe)
- [ ] Test rollback procedure before deployment
- [ ] Maintain 2+ previous versions for quick access
